Suppose you're trying to model the relationship between the size of a house in square feet and its market value. Maybe your friend
came to you knowing only the square footage of their home, asking for an accurate estimate of what the property might be worth. Or maybe
they're looking to renovate the home for some extra selling value and are wondering how much more they would receive per square foot.
