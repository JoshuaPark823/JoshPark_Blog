I'm Josh - a Full Stack SWE with a passion for Machine Learning and Software Design.

Alongside my studies at McGill University, I worked full time as a Full Stack Developer, building enterprise software using modern web technologies. 
Over the years I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to mentor engineering interns, resolve issues in production, 
and build CI/CD pipelines from scratch. It's through these experiences that I've been humbled by how much more there is to learn.

Currently, I work as a Software Developer at Applied Systems in an Agile, Test-driven team.

Here's my daily tech stack:

- Python/Django/PostgreSQL
- JavaScript/React
- Docker

Here's the stack I was working with previously:

- Typescript, Angular, RxJS, HTML/CSS/Sass
- C#, .NET Core/MVC
- SQL/MSSQL, SQL Server
- Azure DevOps + CI/CD

Methodologies, Processes, and Tools

- Agile Methodology, Scrum
- Git Flow
- Jira, Confluence
