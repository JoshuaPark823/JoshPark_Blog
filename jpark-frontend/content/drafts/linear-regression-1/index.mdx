Recently I've started diving more into machine learning methods through Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization and it's been very interesting.
To keep track of some of my progress and to share some of the insights that I've been gaining, I've decided to make my notes on the topics public.

Generally, they'll be unstructured lists of talking points, screenshots, and pieces of information that I found useful and rephrased for my 
own understanding. Andrew is an amazing lecturer and I'd urge anyone interested in ML to go and watch some of his lectures as well.

### Overview and Applications

1. From a high level, what are some possible applications of machine learning? Before diving into any of the methods, it's interesting to think of what could
be possible with this kind of technology.

    - Autonomous driving
    - Large scale agriculture
    - Anomaly detection (Spam, Fraud, etc.)
    - Applications in Retail, Transport, Factories
